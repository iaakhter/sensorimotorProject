This is a program that simulates eye saccades using supervised learning (artificial neural network) in an OpenGL environment. 
Run eyeCameraMl for simulation. Blue box represents the target. The red box represents the gaze of the camera which represents the eye in our simulation. The user can move the target using mouse clicks. When the target is moved, the camera rotates/performes a saccade in an attempt to see the moved target. When the red box, surrounds the target, the camera is seeing the target perfectly. Otherwise, there is an error in the saccade.
